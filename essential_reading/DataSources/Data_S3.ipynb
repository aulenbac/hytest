    "One of the main storage locations for HyTest data is in '_The Cloud_'. This is sometimes referred to as **'Object Storage'**.  The data is kept in datacenters, which makes it easily available to network-connected devices. The main advantage of doing this is that if your compute engine is also in that same datacenter (as is the case for many JupyterHub nodes), the data doesn't have to go very far to get to the compute power.  This brings the computation to the data, rather than shipping large datasets across the internet to get to the compute engine. \n",
