# ADR - Architectural Decision Records

This is a lightweight documentation system meant to record
high-level decisions taken during the design of the project.
See <https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions>
for the inspiration.

ADRs are typically used on larger projects. We include them here
to keep track of foundational decisions which affect contributors
over the longer term.  ADRs start as a [new issue](https://github.com/hytest-org/hytest/issues/new) tagged with <kbd>ADR</kbd>.  Discussion and decisions are included
in the issue's discussion thread. They are added to this index once accepted as a
convenience to see them all in one place. (also available by
a [search of the issues in this repo](https://github.com/hytest-org/hytest/issues?q=label%3AADR).
