# ADR - Architectural Decision Records

This is a lightweight documentation system meant to record
high-level decisions taken during the design of the project.
See <https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions>
for the inspiration.

ADRs are typically used on larger projects. We include them here
to keep track of foundational decisions which affect contributors
over the longer term. 

For this project, we will not track ADRs as text/markdown files in our repository, as is typically done. Instead, we expect all major decisions to begin as a Github issue, and we expect a discussion and decisions to be made within that thread. To begin a discussion around a new decision point, a contributor should start a [new issue](https://github.com/hytest-org/hytest/issues/new) tagged with <kbd>ADR</kbd>. Once that issue comes to a resolution, it will be added to this index as a
convenience to see them all in one place. You can also find all ADRs by
a [search of the issues in this repo](https://github.com/hytest-org/hytest/issues?q=label%3AADR).
