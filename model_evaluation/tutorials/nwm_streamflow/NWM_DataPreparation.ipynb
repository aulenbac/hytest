    "    * This may involve interpolation to estimate a more granular time-step\n",
    "    * More often, an agregating function is used to 'down-sample' the dataset to a coarser time step (days vs hours).\n",
    "* Coordinate aggregation units between simulated and observed \n",
    "    * Gridded data may be sampled per HUC-12, HUC-6, etc. to match modeled data indexed by these units. \n",
    "    * Index formats may be adjusted (e.g. a 'gage_id' may be 'USGS-01104200' in one data set, vs '01104200' in another)\n",
    "* Re-Chunking the data to make time-series analysis more efficient (see [here](/dev/null) for a primer on re-chunking).\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, a given variable should be represented as a pair of 2D array of values (one for simulated, one for observed). \n",
    "One dimension of the array is indexed by some nominal data field ('gage_id', 'HUC-12 ID', etc), while the other dimension \n",
